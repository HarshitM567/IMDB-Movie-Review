# IMDB-Movie-Review

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. Leveraging the sequential nature of text data, the RNN processes word embeddings to capture contextual relationships and sentiment patterns. The model is trained on the IMDB dataset, containing 50,000 movie reviews with balanced labels.
